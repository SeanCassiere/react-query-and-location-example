# React Query example app

This is a simple React app scaffolded with Vite, to try out [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview).

## TLDR

When I tried out tRPC with NextJS, it provides a React client hook which is a (thin) wrapper around react-query. As such, I wanted to see how the package worked on its own.

## Data / API

The data displayed via this application is from the popular public API - [JSON Placeholder Typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
