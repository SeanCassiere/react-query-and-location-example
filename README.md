# React-Query and React-Location example app

This is a simple React app scaffolded with Vite, to try out [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview) and [react-location](https://react-location.tanstack.com/).

## TLDR

When I tried out tRPC with NextJS, it provides a React client hook which is a (thin) wrapper around react-query. As such, I wanted to see how the package worked on its own.

In addition to this, while browsing the other packages in the Tanstack, I noticed the native integrations between react-location and react-query and wanted to try it out as well.
